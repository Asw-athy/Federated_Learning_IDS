# Federated Learning for Intrusion Detection System (FLIDS)

## Overview
This project implements a **Federated Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (FLIDS)** using the **UNSW_NB15 dataset**. The system leverages machine learning techniques, including **XGBoost** and **Deep Learning**, to detect and classify network intrusions. A **Digital Twin Validation** mechanism ensures the reliability of model updates in a federated learning environment.

## Features
- **Federated Learning (FL)**: Decentralized training of IDS models while preserving data privacy.
- **Digital Twin Validation**: Ensures anomaly-free model updates.
- **Binary & Multiclass Classification**: Detects both normal and malicious network traffic.
- **Streamlit UI**: Interactive web interface for user authentication and intrusion detection.
- **CustomFedAvg Strategy**: Optimized model aggregation in FL.
- **Live Model Training & Validation**: Real-time anomaly detection and classification.
